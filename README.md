# Cpp-template-project

Template structure for a c++ project with cmake and googletests

# Why this exists?

I use CLion to code, however, sometimes its useful to have a code template for a project, since this takes some time to structure.

# What to do?

When you are starting a project, and you don't have a template set in you IDE, you can use this one. What you do is clone the repo, and replace the .git
folder with the .git you want, and you can work normally.
